# The Spatial Data Ecosystem in R ðŸŒŽ

I gave a talk to my fellow researchers at the [Center for Spatial Data Science](https://spatial.uchicago.edu/) on May 8, 2018 about the new `sf` package, and my sense of the evolving spatial data ecosystem in R. Here are the slides from the talk!

**I am currently starting work on a project for the Center for Spatial Data Science that aims to put together an introductory website for those starting to learn spatial analysis. I would love to hear from you what types of resources would be helpful in your day-to-day work, and what types of problems you hope to solve with spatial analysis. See below for my contact info.**
